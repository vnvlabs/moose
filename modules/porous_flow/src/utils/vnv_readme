Steps:

1. Add a vnv.C file that is compiled into the library
2. Add a empty vnv_<PACKAGENAME>.C file. This ensures the file is added to the build
3. run bear make  -> this generates the compile commands
4. .../vnv-matcher --package <PACKAGE_NAME> --output src/vnv ./compile_commands.json
5. make 

6. In future:
    a) if you add a source file, you need to regenerate the compile commands.
    b) if you edit an existing source file you should run vnv matcher again
    c) after running matcher, you need to rebuild
    d) users just run make as normal.
