# The geochemistry module

The geochemistry module is designed to solve geochemical models.  The capabilities include:

- equilibrium aqueous systems
- redox disequilibrium
- sorption and surface complexation
- kinetics
- all these combined with fluid and heat transport

The geochemistry module is designed to interface easily with the porous-flow module so that complicated reactive transport scenarios can be studied.
