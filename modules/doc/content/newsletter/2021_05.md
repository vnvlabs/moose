## Weighted Gap Mortar Mechanical Contact Implementation

We have implemented a variationally consistent discretization scheme for the
zero-penetration mechanical contact constraints. Interested readers may refer to
the associated [issue](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/issues/16961) and
[pull request](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/pull/17189).

## Post-processors Usable in Initial Conditions

We added [/PostprocessorInterface.md] to initial conditions. Post-processor
values can now be retrieved using `getPostprocessorValue()` and `getPostprocessorValueByName()`,
and these post-processors will be executed before the initial condition as long
as their `execute_on` parameters include `INITIAL`.
