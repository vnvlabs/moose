# Source Repository Access

The following instructions should be used to aid you in obtaining full source access to the NCRC codes for which you have been authorized to access.

Most of the NCRC codes are maintained on an internal INL Gitlab server. To access this server, we recommend that you follow the remote access instructions
on the MOOSE Developers' [Remote Access](help/inl/hpc_remote.md) page.

Once you have an active SSH tunnel and SOCKS proxy setup you can navigate to the internal webserver here where you may clone the software, open tickets and interact
with the maintainers of those projects:

!alert note
You must be connected to the INL network via the SSH instructions above or the INL VPN if you are an employee.


Some of our projects have been moved to our externally facing Gitlab server. You may access this server without any special configuration if you have been granted
access to one of the following projects:
